This program was created as part of the artificial intelligence module for my game software engineering course.

Make sure there is a .txt document named "map" (exclude the speech marks) in the same file as the .exe
The first 2 characters of the map file must declare the length and height of the map and cannot be greater than 9.
The total amount of numbers in the file must be equal to the first two multiplied.
Number 1 is an obstacle
Number 2 is the start (only include 1)
Number 3 is the goal (only include 1)
Example: 2 3 2 1 0 1 0 3
This looks like
21
01
03
to the algorithm.
